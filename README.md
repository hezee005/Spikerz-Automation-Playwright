# **GitHub Actions Workflow
Ensure your repository’s GitHub Actions secrets contain the following environment variables:

- `BASE_URL`
- `SPK_USERNAME`
- `SPK_PASSWORD`
- `GMAIL_USERNAME`
- `SPK_PASSWORD`

Example configuration in the workflow file:

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: lts/*
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
      env:
        BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.BASE_URL }}
        GOOGLE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_USERNAME }}
        GOOGLE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_PASSWORD }}
        PROFILE_PICTURE_URL: ${{ secrets.PROFILE_PICTURE_URL }}
        TARGET_YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID: ${{ secrets.TARGET_YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID }}
        USERNAME: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
        PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30
```


# **Test Structure
- `tests/` – Contains all test files
- `pages/` – Page Object Model (POM) classes for better test maintainability
- `utils/` – Utility functions, such as authentication helpers
- `playwright.config.js` – Playwright configuration file

## Security Considerations
- Avoid logging sensitive data
- Use .env instead of hardcoding credentials

## Error Handling & Debugging
- Run tests with DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test to see API calls
- Check Playwright’s trace viewer with --trace on-first-retry
